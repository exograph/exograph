# Workflow for building and publishing Docker image

# Triggered on release (note that the build-binaries workflow publishes in the pre-release mode).
# This allows minimizing the time between the release (which is a manual step) and the availability of the Docker image.

# Performs:
# - Download the binaries from the release
# - Build the Docker image
# - Push the Docker image to the registry
