/// Build a [ModelSystem] given an [AstSystem].
///
/// First, it type checks the input [AstSystem] to produce typechecked types.
/// Next, it resolves the typechecked types. Resolving a type entails consuming annotations and finalizing information such as table and column names.
/// Finally, it builds the model type through a series of builders.
///
/// Each builder implements the following pattern:
/// - build_shallow: Build relevant shallow types.
///   Each shallow type in marked as primitive and thus holds just the name and notes if it is an input type.
/// - build_expanded: Fully expand the previously created shallow type as well as any other dependent objects (such as Query and Mutation)
///
/// This two pass method allows dealing with cycles.
/// In the first shallow pass, each builder iterates over resolved types and create a placeholder model type.
/// In the second expand pass, each builder again iterates over resolved types and expand each model type
/// (this is done in place, so references created from elsewhere remain valid). Since all model
/// types have been created in the first pass, the expansion pass can refer to other types (which may still be
/// shallow if hasn't had its chance in the iteration, but will expand when its turn comes in).
