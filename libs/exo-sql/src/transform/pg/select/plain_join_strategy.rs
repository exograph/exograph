/// Strategy that uses a plain join of tables involved in clauses
///
/// Suitable for:
/// - For aggregate output: Only many-to-one predicates without order-by, limit or offset.
/// - For non-aggregate output: Only many-to-one predicates or order-by; or where duplicate rows can
///   be tolerated (typically for a subquery)
///
/// Pre-conditions (for aggregate output):
/// - Order by is none
/// - Limit and offsets are none
/// - Predicates that are only of many-to-one kind. Specifically, meeting one of the following conditions:
///     - No predicate (such as `concerts { ... }`)
///     - Predicate referring to columns of the root table (such as `concerts(where: {id: {gt: 10}})`)
///     - Predicate referring to columns of a table navigable though many-to-one relationships such as:
///         - `concerts(where: {venue: {id: {gt: 10}}})`
///         - `concerts(where: {venue: {city: {name: {eq: "San Francisco"}}}})`)
///
/// Pre-conditions (for non-aggregate output):
/// - Predicate along with order-by refers to only many-to-one relationships (such as `concerts(orderBy: {venue: {name: ASC}})`)
///   -- or --
/// - Explicit specification indicating that duplicate rows are allowed
///
/// If the predicate refers to a single table, we build the aggregate directly from the table's data
/// to produce a statement like:
///
/// ```sql
/// SELECT COALESCE(...)::text FROM "concerts" WHERE "concerts"."id" > $1
/// ```
///
/// If the predicate refers to multiple tables connected by many-to-one relationships, we use a join
/// of the tables. For example, consider the following query:
///
/// ```graphql
/// {
///   concerts(where: {venue: {id: {gt: 10}}}) {
///     ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// Here, we join the root table with the one that the predicate refers to produce a statement like:
///
/// ```sql
/// SELECT COALESCE(...)::text FROM "concerts" LEFT JOIN "venues" ON "concerts"."venue_id" = "venues"."id" WHERE "venues"."id" < $1
/// ```
/// We can do the same for any depth of predicates as long as the relationships are of many-to-one kind.
///
/// These single-table and multi-many-to-one work in the same conceptual way, since with a single
/// table, the "join" becomes just the table itself.
///
/// :::caution
/// The many-to-one is a critical constraint while forming such queries. Otherwise, if a one-to-many
/// relationship is involved, the join will return multiple rows for each "many" side, and we will
/// end up with duplicate entries in the result.
