/// The core idea in this library is that of [AbstractOperation], which along with
/// its variants, allows declaring an intention of a database operation at a higher
/// level. It also offers [DatabaseExecutor], which is responsible for transforming
/// an [AbstractOperation] into one or more SQL operations and executing them. This
/// separation of intention vs execution allows for simplified expression from the
/// user of the library and leaves out the details of the database operations.
/// Although, currently it focuses solely on Postgres support, it should be easy to
/// extend to other databases.
///
/// For example, consider [AbstractSelect]. It allows expressing the intention to
/// query data by specifying the root table, a predicate, and (potentially nested)
/// columns (among other things). It doesn't, however, express how to execute
/// the query; specifically, it doesn't specify any joins to be performed.
/// Similarly, [AbstractInsert] expresses an intention to insert logical rows
/// (columns into the root table as well as any referenced tables), but doesn't
/// specify how to go about doing so.
///
/// To allow expressing complex operations such as predicates based on nested
/// elements, the library requires the use of [ColumnPath]s in the predicates and
/// order by expressions. A [ColumnPath] is a path from the root table of the
/// operation to the intended column. Similarly, to allow inserting nested elements,
/// the library requires expressing the columns to be inserted as
/// [InsertionElement]s, which abstracts over columns and nested elements.
///
/// This crate also contains, but doesn't expose, lower level primitives for SQL
/// operations.
