//! Abstraction to allow inserting rows into a table as well as related tables.
//!
//! This allows us to execute GraphQL mutations like this:
//! ```graphql
//! mutation {
//!   createVenue(data: {name: "v1", published: true, latitude: 1.2, concerts: [
//!     {title: "c1", published: true, price: 1.2},
//!     {title: "c2", published: false, price: 2.4}
//!   ]}) {
//!     id
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Here, concerts created will have their `venue_id` set to the id of the venue being created.
