# This crate is intended to be built only on Linux platforms.
#
# Once https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5220 is resolved,
# we will be able to include this crate in the workspace only for the linux target.
# Until then, we need to scope dependencies to the linux target as well as mark
# each source file as `#![cfg(target_os = "linux")]`.
