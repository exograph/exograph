# Telemetry

Exograph includes support for console logging as well as [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect and export telemetry data.

## Console logging

Exograph enables console logging by default and sets its level to "info". You may control the output by setting the `EXO_LOG` environment variable. For example, setting `EXO_LOG=trace` will enable very verbose "trace" level logging.

The log level can also be varied for different libraries used to build the server. For example, `EXO_LOG=debug,h2=warn` will enable debug level logging but disable the verbose output from the Rust `h2` library which is mostly low-level network protocol information.

Underneath the hood, Exograph uses the [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) library, which provides a rich set of options for controlling the output. The `EXO_LOG` environment variable behaves identically to the `RUST_LOG` variable in the `tracing` library.
Please see the [EnvFilter documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) to tune the output for specific crates and modules.

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry support is built in to the exograph server and can be enabled simply by setting standard [environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/). A subset of these are supported, including:

- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` to set the name of your service.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to set the endpoint to export trace data to.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` the OTLP version used. Can be `grpc` (the default) or `http/protobuf`.
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` allows you to set custom headers such as authentication tokens.

For example, to export data to Honeycomb, you can set the variables:

```
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my_exo_server
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io:443
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=your-api-key"
```

You should then see tracing output in your dashboard:
