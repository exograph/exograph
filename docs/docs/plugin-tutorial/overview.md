# Overview

Plugins are a way in which Exograph integrates with other systems and modules. Exograph ships a few plugins provided by default (like the Deno and PostgreSQL plugins). However, it also provides an API to let advanced users build custom plugins.

This section will walk you through creating a key-value plugin to store and retrieve user-defined models with a string key.

:::warning
This is a work in progress. The plugin API is still evolving and requires effort to make this work. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EPdqyvCpNw).
