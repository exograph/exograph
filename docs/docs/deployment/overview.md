# Overview

In the [application tutorial](/application-tutorial/whats-next.md), we left off with deploying an Exograph server locally. We take the next step to deploy the server to the cloud. We will cover two deployment scenarios:

- Deploying to a traditional server: We will use [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [Railway](https://railway.app) as examples. However, since we will be building a Docker image in either case, you can use any cloud provider that supports Docker.
- Deploying in a serverless environment: We will use AWS Lambda, where we will use [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to create the infrastructure.
