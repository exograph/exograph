# Cloudflare Workers

Let's deploy our application to [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

The application needs a Postgres database. We will use [Neon](https://neon.tech/), a "multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier". This free tier is perfect for this tutorial. If you want to use other Postgres providers, the basic steps remain the same: create a database and set the `EXO_POSTGRES_URL` environment variable to point to it.

:::info Only Postgres is supported
Currently, Exograph on Workers supports only Postgres modulesâ€”that is, it does not support Deno modules. We are working on utilizing the host JavaScript engine to support JavaScript/TypeScript modules instead of Deno modules to offer the same functionality.

## Creating a new application

If you already have an application, you can skip this step.

import CreatingApp from './\_creating_app.md';

<CreatingApp/>

## Creating Deployment Files

Exograph CLI includes a command to simplify deploying to Cloudflare Workers.

```shell-session
# shell-command-next-line
exo deploy cf-worker
```

This command creates the WebAssembly binaries, `wrangler.toml`, and `.dev.vars` to configure the application.

The `wrangler.toml` file defines environment variables and bindings for your production deployment. You should commit this file to your repository (therefore, you should not include secrets in this file).

The `.dev.vars` file contains the environment variables for _local_ development. You must update this file to point to a development Postgres database. Typically, you don't need to commit this file to your repository.

## Trying it out locally

To run the backend locally, modify `.dev.vars` to point to your development Postgres URL. Then run the following command:

```shell-session
# shell-command-next-line
npx wrangler dev
```

It will start a local server at `http://localhost:8787` (it may use another port if 8787 isn't available). To test the application, you can launch `exo playground` and set the endpoint to `http://localhost:8787`.

```shell-session
# shell-command-next-line
exo playground --endpoint http://localhost:8787
```

You can try queries and mutation to test the application with your development Postgres database.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

Before you try accessing the application, you must connect the worker to a Postgres database. You can do so by provisioning a Postgres database and setting the `EXO_POSTGRES_URL` secret:

```sh
# shell-command-next-line
exo secret set EXO_POSTGRES_URL <postgres-database-url>
```

Alternatively, for database providers like Neon and Supabase, you can use the Cloudflare Workers "Integration" tab, click "Add Integration", and follow the instructions. The result will be setting the `DATABASE_URL` secret for you.

Next, run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in the database.

```sh
exo schema migrate --database <postgres-database-url> --apply-to-database
```

Finally, let's deploy to Cloudflare.

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

That's it! You now have a GraphQL server connected to a Postgres database running on Cloudflare Workers.

If you wish to play with the APIs, launch the playground by running the following command:

```sh
exo playground --endpoint <cloudflare-worker-url>
```

You can try the typical queries, such as creating a new todo, as seen in the [Getting Started](../getting-started#using-the-graphiql-interface) guide.

## Improving latency

With the earlier configuration, the Exograph worker connected directly to the database. Due to the ephemeral nature of Cloudflare Workers, every request establishes a new connection to the database, which can be slow. You can improve the latency by using [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/).

To set up a Hyperdrive, use the `npx wrangler hyperdrive create` command or the Cloudflare Worker's dashboard. Then add the following to your `wrangler.toml` (you will get the `id` from the command output or the Hyperdrive dashboard):

```toml
EXO_HYPERDRIVE_BINDING = "<binding-name>"

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "<binding-name>"
id = "..."
```

The worker will now use Hyperdrive to manage the database connections, significantly reducing the latency of the requests.
