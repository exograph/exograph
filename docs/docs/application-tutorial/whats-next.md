# What's next

In this application tutorial, we have covered the basics of Exograph. We have seen how to create Postgres types, how to implement Deno modules, and how to use the Exograph CLI to create a schema and start a server.

As a next step, you can try deploying this model to cloud providers as a traditional server and AWS Lambda. See the [deployment guide](/deployment/overview.md) for more information.

You could also write some tests to ensure your application works as expected. See the [testing guide](/production/testing.md) for more information.
