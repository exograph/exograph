# Overview

While the simple app developed in the [previous section](/getting-started/index.md#using-the-graphiql-interface) is a good starting point, a real-work application needs more. In this section, we will create a fully-featured application that will demonstrate several capabilities of Exograph. Among them:

1. Creating relations
2. Expressing access control rules
3. Expressing custom business logic
4. Creating custom performance monitoring
5. Deploying to a cloud platform
6. Deploying to AWS Lambda

:::info Source Code
It is best to follow this tutorial step-by-step, but you can find the source code for the final version [here](https://github.com/exograph/examples/tree/main/concerts-app).
