# Overview

Exograph supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), enabling you to connect your Exograph model to any MCP client. Once you define your Exograph model, there's very little else you need to do to start using it with LLMs. 

In the [MCP tutorial](/mcp-tutorial), we walked through setting up an MCP client (Claude Desktop) to answer questions based on your database. In this section, we'll explore how it works and how you can configure it for use in agentic workflows.
