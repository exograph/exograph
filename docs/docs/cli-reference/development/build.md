# exo build

When you are ready to deploy your Exograph project in production, you can use the `build` command to create the exo_ir file. You can then pass this file to the `exo-server` to run your application.

The `build` command must be invoked from the project's root directory.

```bash
# shell-command-next-line
exo build
Exograph Intermediate Representation file 'index.exo_ir' created in 41 milliseconds
You can start the server with using the 'exo-server' command
```
