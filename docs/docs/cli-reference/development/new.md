# exo new

The `exo new` command creates a new skeleton Exograph project in the specified directory.

## Usage

```shell-session
# shell-command-next-line
exo new <directory>

The `exo new` command takes one argument: the directory in which to create the project. If the directory does not exist, it will create it.
