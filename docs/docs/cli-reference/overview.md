# Overview

Exograph's cli tools--`exo` and `exo-server`--serve as the main entry point to the Exograph ecosystem. Together, they provide a set of commands to help you develop your application model, work with the database schema, and run the server.

## Development cli

During development, you will use the `exo` command. Please see the [development cli reference](development/overview.md) for more information.

## Production cli

When you are ready to deploy your server, you will first use `exo build` and then use the `exo-server` command. Please see the [production cli reference](production/exo-server.md) for more information.
