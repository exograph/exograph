# How to use

Run `npm run build` to process the `claytip.tmLanguage.template.json` file.

# Development

1. Open the vscode-extension folder into a separate VSCode window. Then press the "Debug" button (the triangle on the left side). Then run the extension.
2. In the window opened by the debugger, open example.clay to check the syntax highlighting.
3. Run `npm run build` every time you change the `claytip.tmLanguage.template.json` file.

Tip: `View` -> `Command Palette` -> `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scope` is a very useful tool. It will bring up a palette and as you click around an example file, it will show matching scopes.
